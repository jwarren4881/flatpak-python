# Python Flatpak

This GitHub Repository goes along with [this blog post on my 
website](https://www.loganasherjones.com/2018/05/using-flatpak-with-python/) 
Please check it out!

Each of the subdirectories is a different flatpak build meant to demonstrate
a different part of the blog post. Follow along or build yourself.

## Usage

To use this repository, you'll need to install [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) 
and `flatpak-builder`. Each individual project has a `README.md` that will
tell you how to run the specific project and what to expect for output.
